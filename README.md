# push_swap
I'm guessing this is the project where you learn about every single sorting algorithm, time complexity, then eventually create your own terrible algorithm to pass the assignment. 

Fuck push_swap. Moving on for now! 

Checker is done, small sort is done, one day you'll handle the medium/large sort.
Learn how to make your code more modular so you can consistently reuse functions. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I hope the main lesson imparted upon you after failing this project is that modular readable code is extremely important. The fact that you included no documentation made it nigh-impossible to understand your own code. The lack of testing and writing matters out on paper made it so that you made tons of mistakes that were easily fixable. The lack of modularity meant that you had to re-create functions with extraordinarily minor changes, and it made the whole process overwhelmingly confusing. You need to find a way to make trustworthy functions that can be constantly reused... and it's of vital importance to plan the creation of your programs beforehand.
