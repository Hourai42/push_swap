# push_swap
I'm guessing this is the project where you learn about every single sorting algorithm, time complexity, then eventually create your own terrible algorithm to pass the assignment. 

Fuck push_swap. Moving on for now! 

Checker is done, small sort is done, one day you'll handle the medium/large sort.
Learn how to make your code more modular so you can consistently reuse functions.
