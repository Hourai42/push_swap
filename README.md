# push_swap

A program that takes in a list of numbers onto a stack, then has to sort said stack using another stack. Essentially, you have 2 stacks to sort a list of numbers. 

A limited number of operations are given
- swap 2 elements on stack a
- swap 2 elements on stack b
- both the above at the same time

- push element on top of stack a to top of stack b
- push element on top of stack b to top of stack a
- both the above at the same time

- rotate stack a, first element becomes last
- rotate stack b, first element becomes last
- both the above at same time

- reverse rotate stack a, last element becomes the first
- reverse rotate stack b, last element becomes the first
- both the above at the same time
